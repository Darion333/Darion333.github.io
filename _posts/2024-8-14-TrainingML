title: Tutorial 2. Training the Machine Learning Model
---

Definition of Classification vs Regression problem. 
  Give examples about Classification vs Regression tasks.
  This is a classification task.
Commonly used classification algorithms (explain each idea and point the readers to online resource to learn more about the methods):
Logistic regression. 
  Random forest.
  Support Vector Machine
How to train an ML model?
  Training set vs test set
    What we need them
    How to split them (reasonable ratio)
  Evaluation the perform of classification task: 
    accuracy, TP, FP, TN, FN, ROC curve etc.
    Performance on the training set vs performance on the test set
Show the code to train the ML models
  Introduce Scikit learn
  Explain which function does the train/test splitting
  Explain which function performs the training
