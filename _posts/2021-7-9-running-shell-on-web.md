title: Tutorial 7. Learn Linux commands without a Linux computer
---

### Learning objectives

* Find resources where you can test Linux commands when you don't have a Linux computer

## Introduction

Most computational chemistry labs use resources on supercomputers, where we need to use Linux commands. However, if you are planning to join a computational lab but haven't got access to a supercomputer yet, is there a way to try running Linux commands by yourself?
The answer is yes! In this tutorial, you will find ways to run Linux commands on your computer!

1. Linux users: If you use Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat, SUSE, Fedora, etc.) for your personal computer, you can try the Linux commands in the Terminal. But most of you may use other operating systems.
2. Mac users: you can also run Linux commands in the Terminal.
3. Windows users: there are many tutorials about how to run Bash (a type of Linux shell) on Windows computer. For example, by installing Anaconda and Git Bash following this [tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-git-bash-conda/)

However, as a beginner, you may accidentally delete files on your computer when practicing the commands you just learned. More serious damage to the filesystem can also happen if you use sudos without extra care!

Is there a way to safely run Linux commands without hurting anyone?

## Try and Learn
Yes, you can practice running Linux commands on a virtual machine for free!

For example, [webminal](https://www.webminal.org/) is a free Linux online terminal that contains lessons on the usage of Linux commands. You can go to the website, register as a user, then launch the Terminal in your browser, and you are ready to learn Linux! Without any potential harm to your computer!

Here is a video [tutorial](https://youtu.be/57nPeR8T_gI) about how to use the resources on [webminal](https://www.webminal.org/).
