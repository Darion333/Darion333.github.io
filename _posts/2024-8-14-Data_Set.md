title: Tutorial 1. Configuring the Data Set
---

### Learning objectives
* Understand the basics of Chemoinformatics
* Interpret the raw data set
* Using API's like PubChem and RDKit to transfigure data

## Background

Identifying cancerous molecules is crucial for scientific research, especially when these molecules are used in various studies. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are molecules formed by multiple carbon rings. While some PAH molecules are carcinogenic, others are not, making distinguishing between them necessary in research settings.

Chemoinformatics is the scientific field that studies or predicts a moleculeâ€™s properties through informational techniques. Referencing a fundamental principle in chemistry, the similarity principle ,where molecules of similar structures exhibit similar properties, we can develop a machine learning model to classify PAH molecules. This model will compare the structures of unknown PAHs with those of molecules that have already been classified, predicting their carcinogenic potential.

Additionally, We will use external libraries such as PubChemPy and RDKit. These tools will first represent the molecular structures as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. The SMILES strings will then be converted into Morgan fingerprints, an array format that represents a molecule's structure in binary. This conversion is critical, as the molecular names stored as strings are insufficient for computational processing.

### Setting up the Data set

For our purposes, we will be using a this set of PAH molecules 

[PAH.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17249526/PAH.tar.gz)

In the file there should be 82 different chemical compounds within the train set such as

and 10 chemical compounds within the test set

Using one of our APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), PubChem, we can access the structural information of each of the molecules from just their name. For example:

When searching up 1,2-Dimethylbenzo[a]pyrene in the PubChem website, all of its strucural data will be given, including a 2D depiction like this one.

In PubChem, it is also able to provide a "SMILES String" for that molecule. A SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string is a simple notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings, like so:

We can directly convert a set of molecule names into a set of SMILE strings using code by defining a function to do so, as shown in the code below:

```python
def getSMILES(df):
    mols=df['molecule'].values
    smiles_list = []
    for mol in mols:
        # Get rid of the ".ct" suffix
        # Search Pubchem by the compound name
        try:
            results = pcp.get_compounds(mol[:-3], 'name')
            smiles = ""
            if len(results) > 0:
                # Get the SMILES string of the compound
                smiles = results[0].isomeric_smiles
                smiles_list.append(smiles)
                print(mol[:-3],smiles)
            else:
                smiles_list.append(smiles)
                print(mol[:-3],'molecule not found in PubChem')
        except:
            print(f"{mol} can not be extracted")
            smiles_list.append('nan')
    df['SMILES'] = smiles_list
```
